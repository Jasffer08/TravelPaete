Learn the Javascript • Implement a button control with event handler. • Understand the syntax
rules for functions, variables, identifiers and assignment’s • Learn about the Document Object Control

History JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape
Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self.
In late 1995, when Microsoft cottoned-on to the competitive threat the Web posed, the Internet
Explorer project was started in an all-out attempt to wrestle control of the emerging platform
from Netscape.
In so doing Microsoft became a mortal threat, compelling Netscape to respond. First, they started
a standardization process to prevent Microsoft gaining control of the JavaScript language.
Second, they partnered with Sun to leverage their shared interest in breaking the Microsoft
monopoly.
Sun began development of Java in 1990 in an attempt to write a language for “smart
appliances”. This approach floundered and in 1994, Sun regrouped and set sights on the Web as
the delivery platform of choice. Sun did have a browser in 1995 before the Netscape partnership,
but it was slow and resource hungry.
So the Netscape/Sun partnership meant Sun acquired the use of a competitive browser and a
delivery system for their strategic technology.
2
Netscape, on the other hand found a powerful ally against Microsoft. They also aimed to
outmanoeuvre Microsoft by being the official browser of the highly anticipated platform that
was Java.
Brendan Eich has said that with Sun on board, they decided to surf the tidal wave of hype
surrounding Java and position JavaScript as the companion language to Java, in the same way
Visual Basic was to C++. So the name was a straightforward marketing ploy to gain acceptance.
Netscape’s Mocha (later JavaScript) aimed to turn the web into a full-blown application
platform.
Furthermore, when used together with their LiveWire application server product, it would
enable isomorphic development, with the same language used on both client and server. If this
sounds familiar, it is because this was exactly what Sun was attempting to pull off with Java. At
the time however, the Web was very limited when compared to Java; for example, drawing
pixels was not possible in JavaScript as it is now with canvas. So Sun (erroneously, I believe)
never saw the language as a competitor and the alliance held.
Unfortunately for JavaScript, its early market positioning outlived its usefulness and later
became a brake on market acceptance as it emerged as a viable technology in its own right.
So JavaScript was conceived as a scripting language for the Web for both client and server side.
It was then quickly re-positioned as a Web “companion” for Java. The unique circumstances of
the birth of the language, including:
the aforementioned marketing ploy, time-compressed initial development, a prejudice that
development for the Web was not “serious”, the ubiquitous and “unbreakable” deployment
environment (the Web), and the inclusion of language design elements unfamiliar to most
developers.
Led to a years-long period of misunderstanding, scorn and, yes, even hatred for the language. In
the late 1990s and early 2000s even the authors of some books on JavaScript didn’t understand
the fundamental elements of the language.
Douglas Crockford was one of the pioneers of the rediscovery of the language. And the
importance of his invention of the JSON data format using a subset of JavaScript syntax should
not be underestimated.
During the 2000s mindshare slowly shifted to view JavaScript as a serious language: a critical
mass of developers emerged who understood the language. However, the “outsider status” of
JavaScript continues to reverberate. Early design choices like automatic semicolon insertion
(ASI), the event loop, lack of classes, unusual inheritance (prototypical) and type coercion are
laughed at by people who have not taken the time to understand the thinking behind them.
Developers watch other developers laughing at these features and infer that these features are
worthy of ridicule and the cycle continues.
Even Brendan Eich, the creator of the language, is occasionally apologetic for design decisions
he made for the language. However, in my view these expressions of apology should not be
3
taken as confirmation that those decisions were wrong: but rather acknowledgement of the
necessary inability of one language to please all developers.
As we will see in later posts, criticisms of JavaScript are frequently insubstantial expressions of
unfamiliarity or syntactic “taste”, by programmers more familiar with other languages. This is
not to say the language is without flaws: the continuing lack of a decimal number primitive is
unfortunate.
Definition JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for
creating networkcentric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript
is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software
Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some
of the key advantages of learning Javascript:
• Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and that makes it a
programmer’s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great frontend
as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS
etc.
 Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn
Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome,
Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.
 Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your
website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User
Experience.
 JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development,
and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.
 Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript.
You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in
the job market.
 Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already
developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to
market.
Applications of Javascript
Programming As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming
languages (Frontend as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software
development. I'm going to list few of them here:
 Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting
it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at frontend itself.
 Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly.
This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify
your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.
4
 User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages
to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.
 Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading backend data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing
experience to your website visitors.
 Presentations -JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives
website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a
webbased slide presentations.
 Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast
and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in
developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers.
Hello World Web Page
When learning a new programming language, your first program is supposed to simply
print “Hello, world!” That’s the traditional Hello World program. Because the program’s
task is so simple, the code is short and it gives the learner an opportunity to focus on the
syntax basics and not get bogged down with too many details. With that said, your first
JavaScript “program” is embedded in FIGURE 1’s Hello web page, which displays
“Hello, world!” when the user clicks the button.

Now take a look at the Hello web page’s source code in FIGURE 2. You can see that there’s
not much JavaScript—it’s just the code in the script container and the code that follows the
onclick attribute. The rest of the web page is HTML code. Later, we’ll explain the JavaScript
code that handles the text replacement when the user clicks the button, but let’s first examine
the HTML code that’s in charge of displaying the web page’s button.

JavaScript Statements JavaScript statements are the commands to tell the browser to what
action to perform. Statements are separated by semicolon (;).
JavaScript statement constitutes the JavaScript code which is translated by the browser line
by line.
Example of JavaScript statement:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Welcome";
Following table shows the various JavaScript Statements –

JavaScript Comments
JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, thus:
 Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by
JavaScript.
 Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span
multiple lines.
 JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence<!--. JavaScript
treats this as a single- line comment, just as it does the // comment.-->
 The HTML comment closing sequence  is not recognized by JavaScript so it should
be written as //-->
Example:

JavaScript variable
Variables are referred as named containers for storing information. We can place data
into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.
Rules to declare variable in JavaScript
Here are the important rules that must be followed while declaring a variable in
JavaScript.
 In JavaScript variable names are case sensitive i.e. a is different from A.
 Variable name can only be started with a underscore ( _ ) or a letter (from a to z or A to
Z), or dollar ( $ ) sign.
 Numbers (0 to 9) can only be used after a letter.
 No other special character is allowed in variable name.
Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are
declared with the var keyword as follows –
Variable can be initialized at time of declaration or after declaration as followsJavaScript Data Type
There are two kinds of data types as mentioned below –
 Primitive Data Type
 Non Primitive Data Type
The following table describes Primitive Data Types available in JavaScript
Sr. No. Datatype Description
1 String
8
Can contain groups of character as single value. It is represented in double
quotes. E.g. var x = “tutorial”.
2 Numbers
Contains the numbers with or without decimal. E.g. var x = 44, y=44.56;
3 Booleans
Contain only two values either true or false. E.g var x=true , y=false.
4 Undefined
Variable with no value is called Undefined. E.g. var x;
5 Null
If we assign null to a variable, it becomes empty. E.g. var x=null;
The following table describes Non-Primitive Data Types in JavaScript
Sr.No. Datatype Description
1 Array
Can contain groups of value of same type. E.g. var x={1,2,3,55};
2 Objects
Objects are stored in property and value pain. E.g. var rectangle = {length:
5, breadth: 3};
JavaScript Functions
Function is a group of reusable statements (Code) that can be called any where in a program.
In JavaScript function keyword is used to declare or define a function.
Key Points
 To define a function use function keyword followed by functionname, followed by
parentheses ().
 In parenthesis, we define parameters or attributes.
 The group of reusable statements (code) is enclosed in curly braces {}. This code is
executed whenever function is called.
Syntax
function functionname (p1, p2) {
function coding…

JavaScript Operator
Operators are used to perform operation on one, two or more operands. Operator is
represented by a symbol such as +, =, *, % etc. Following are the operators supported
by javascript –
 Arithmetic Operators
 Comparison Operators
 Logical (or Relational) Operators
 Assignment Operators
 Conditional (or ternary) Operators
 Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators
Following table shows all the arithmetic operators supported by javascript –
Operator Description Example
+ Add two operands 10 + 10 will give 20
- Subtract second operand from the first 10 -10 will give 0
* Multiply two operands. 10 * 30 will give
300
/ Divide numerator by denominator 10/10 will give 1
% It is called modulus operator and gives
remainder of division.
10%10 will give 0
++ Increment operator, increases integer value
by one
10++ will give 11
-- Decrement operator, decreases integer value
by one
10- - will give 9
Comparison Operators
Following table shows all the comparison operators supported by JavaScript –
10
Conditional Operator
It is also called ternary operator, since it has three operands.
Control Structure
Control structure actually controls the flow of execution of a program. Following are the
several control structure supported by JavaScript.
 if…else
 switch case
 do while loop
 while loop
 for loop
If … else
The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to make decisions
and execute statements conditionally.
11
If (expression){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}
Example
<script type=”text/javascript”>
<!—
var age = 20;
if(age>18){
document.write(“<b>Qualifies for driving</b>”);
}
//-->
</script>
Switch case
The basic syntax of the switch statement is to give an expression to evaluate and several
different statements to execute based on the value of the expression. The interpreter checks
each case against the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a
default condition will be used.
Syntax
switch (expression){
case condition 1: statement(s)
 break;
case condition 2: statement(s)
 break;
……
case condition n: statement(s)
12
 break;
default: statement(s)
}
Example
<script type=”text/javascript”>
<!—
var grade=’A’;
document.write(“Entering switch block<br/>”);
switch(grade){
case’A’:document.write(“Good job<br/>”);
break;
case’B’:document.write(“Pretty good</br>”);
break;
case’C’:document.write(“Passed</br>”);
break;
case’D’:document.write(“not so good</br>”);
break;
case’F’:document.write(“failed</br>”);
break;
default:document.write(“Unknown grade</br>”)
}
document.write(“Existing switch block”);
//-->
</script>

Do while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens at the
end of the loop. This means that the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the
condition is false.
Syntax
While Loop
The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as
expression is true. Once expression becomes false, the loop will be exited.
Syntax
while (expression){
Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
14
}
Example
For Loop
The for loop is the most compact form of looping and includes the following three important
parts –
• The loop initialization where we initialize our counter to a starting value. The initialization
statement is executed before the loop begins.
• The test statement which will test if the given condition is true or not. If condition is true
then code given inside the loop will be executed otherwise loop will come out.
15
• The iteration statement where you can increase or decrease your counter.
Syntax
for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
}
Example:
Creating Sample Program
Following is the sample program that shows time, when we click in button.

Output
Document Object Model
The document object represents the whole html document.
When html document is loaded in the browser, it becomes a document object. It is the root
element that represents the html document. It has properties and methods. By the help of
document object, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
As mentioned earlier, it is the object of window. So
1. window.document
Is same as
17
1. document
According to W3C - "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and
language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update
the content, structure, and style of a document."
Properties of document object
Let's see the properties of document object that can be accessed and modified by
the document object.
Methods of document object
We can access and change the contents of document by its methods. The important
methods of document object are as follows:
Accessing field value by document object
18
In this example, we are going to get the value of input text by user. Here, we are using
document.form1.name.value to get the value of name field.
Here, document is the root element that represents the html document.
form1 is the name of the form.
name is the attribute name of the input text.
value is the property, that returns the value of the input text.
Let's see the simple example of document object that prints name with welcome
message.
